## Installer Instructions

### Requirements
- Works best with either: Mac, Linux, Windows (w/ Windows Linux Subsystem enabled)
- Installer can be a little dicey with windows
- python3 must be installed and executable (`python` can be aliased by `alias python=python3`)

### Steps
	1. After downloading the installer, navigate to the directory where it is saved.
	2. run the command `bash installer.sh`
		a) If you get some "/r" errors, cancel the install and delete the created folder, then run `dos2unix installer.sh` and re-run `bash installer.sh`
	3. If the install works properly, some final instructions will be given after the script runs. Follow these instructions.
	4. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/DataCollection/ in a browser and the app should be up and running
